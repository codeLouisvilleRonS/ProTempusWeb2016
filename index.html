It becomes very easy to determine the balance of each client’s trust account. ProTempus will display the balance within ProTempus and QuickBooks also displays their balance in their individual sub account within your trust bank account. You have the option of maintaining your trust bank as a separate QuickBooks company file. This method allows you to optionally give the Bar Association Auditor the QuickBooks trust account without sharing your complete financial data.</p>

Many systems overwhelm their users by displaying all of your tasks on your current To Do list. By default ProTempus will only display tasks that have a trigger date on or prior to the current date. When you come to the office each morning, ProTempus focuses you on the tasks that need to be completed today.

Others like QuickBooks to help balance their bank accounts and to generate the general ledger for year-end tax reports. We have designed a very simple interface with QuickBooks. When you post a payment or deposit into ProTempus, our sync program adds those deposits into the appropriate check register in QuickBooks. Payments are added as deposits into your
		operations accounts, prepayments are added as deposits into the client’s sub account in your trust account check register.

        <p>ProTempus produces audit reports for each step. It verifies the account totals 
before and after each update to ensure your accounts are in balance. 
The trust account report in ProTempus has an optional audit feature that 
retrieves the balance of each client’s from QuickBooks and verifies that the total 
matches the trust account balance in ProTempus. You can optionally segregate 
your trust account into a separate QuickBooks company file that allows auditors 
access to your trust account detail without sharing all of your office’s financial data.
