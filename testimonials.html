		"We love ProTempus. It works the way our office works, it makes sense!"
		-Ken Kasacavage, Henderson Ky.
	</p>
	
	<p>"Ron is always helpful and available. He is creative and tailors Protempus to each user. Protempus is very easy to use and professional. I highly recommend this service for billing!"
		<br>-R. Simms - Louisville, KY
	</p>
	
	<p>
	"ProTempus is so much easier to use than other case management programs that I have used. It helps me keep track of contact information, case information, billing, calendaring...I always know what I should be doing, for whom, when, and where. It's a lifesaver for someone on their own! And support is just as good. Every time I have needed Ron, he's been there and has been able to take of whatever I needed help with. I would highly recommend ProTempus to my attorney friends and colleagues"
		<br>- C. Cornett, Boonesville, KY

	"Ron is a very approachable, helpful, and knowledgeable Individual. As a former TABS III User, who is leery of the "Cloud", I have found ProTempus to be extremely well designed, safe, useful and very Productive. The Billing component has helped me tremendously. The Word Processing and Document Assembly modules are exceptionally easy to use, well-integrated, and my turn around time is getting rather impressive. Especially, when I link them with Dragon Nat Speaking. The Outlook integration features keep me organized. Very Happy with ProTempus."
		<br>- R. Wagoner, Grand Island, NE

	"ProTempus is amazing! I can access information from cases 6 years ago in a matter of a few seconds." 
Mike Maple, Maple & Associates, Louisville, Ky.
